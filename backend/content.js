The Alps boast castles and gardens, spas and yodeling, alpine cowbells and schuplattein dancing. Across distinct mountain cultures and abundant attractions, the Alps are extraordinary even when you’re not wearing skis. Raise your European vacation to its greatest heights in the Alps\n",
        bestTimeToGo:
          "The best time to visit the Alps is in summer, when the mountains are bursting with color, livestock are grazing on high alpine pastures, trails are clear of snow, mountain huts are open, and wildlife re-emerge from their winter slumber. \nSummer in the Alps is equated with active pursuits like hiking, trekking, via ferrata climbing, and cycling. It’s the best time to explore and drink in the mesmerizing scenery of Europe’s highest mountains. \nHowever, summer is also the best time to learn about Alpine culture. In fact, we think you’ll fall in love with the cuisine and culture of the Alps just as much as the landscapes. \n",
        howToGetAround:
          "How to get around\nSome routes are made famous by the incredible scenery reached by traveling with characteristic trains, funiculars, cable cars, ferry and buses. Combining maybe the use of the bicycle, your vacation will be even more memorable.\nThe Alps are served by three major international airports. The TGV and TER trains connect you to the big cities in the region. Shuttles and coach busses help you reach the villages and resorts – or you can always come by car.\n",

          "__1. Fondue__\nOne way to enjoy cheeses from the mountain cows is to make the traditional fondue. Fondue means “melted” in French, and is made with 2 to 3 different cheeses depending on the recipe. You sit with your friends or family around a hot pot of melted cheese and dip pieces of bread. The challenge is not to drop your bread in the common cheese pot. Because it’s a rich warm dish it is typically enjoyed in cooler weather, anytime in the winter and during cool summer nights after a hike.\n\n__2. Raclette__\nThe raclette is another popular way of enjoying melted cheese in the mountains, this time with more flexibility. In the fondue, the cheeses are picked in advance and everyone eats from the same pot. In the raclette, you also share a central heated device. In past times, people in the mountains used wood fires or coals, or gas, for the raclette, while nowadays the devices are mostly electric. The most common raclette device is the one with 6-8 small individual cheese melting containers. However in some restaurants, especially the ones that like to keep it old style, you will find the classic raclette device that hold an entire half wheel of cheese.\n\n__3. Tartiflette__\nMore melted cheese dishes? Welcome to the French Alps. The tartiflette is very similar to the raclette and fondue, but the mixing work is already done for you. Potatoes, lardons (French style bacon}, crème fraiche, and Reblochon cheese are baked in the oven in a gratin casserole style dish.\n",

          "ouch down in any buzzing Alpine city and you’ll be surrounded by snowcapped Alps, teeny villages, and bucolic landscapes spreading out into the horizon. This is two very different worlds in one magnificent trip.\nStart off in Zurich’s car-free old town, walking the Limmatpromenade, and staying up till morning taking in the city’s world-class nightlife. Relish the music, because soon you’ll be in quiet Bregenzerwald, Austria. Twelve villages make up this portal back into a simpler time, and centuries-old farmhouses and cheesemakers set the pace. Going on foot is the best way to soak in the long-lost architecture and serenity of this almost-off-the-map spot.\nAlternatively, make a beeline straight for Germany, where you can contemplate the silence filling the depths of Schwarzwald, or the Black Forest. And yet you’re still not far from 3-star Michelin restaurants and water-filled adventures — Lake Titisee, the largest lake in this untamed wilderness, is right here, too (be sure to dip your toes).\n",

The region around Machu Picchu, including the Sacred Valley, Inca Trail and colonial city of Cusco, is rich in archaeological sites. On Peru’s arid Pacific coast is Lima, the capital, with a preserved colonial center and important collections of pre-Columbian art.",
        bestTimeToGo:
          "The winter (May – September) is the driest season and therefore the best time of year to travel, especially if you're planning to visit Cusco or trek to Machu Picchu. The summer (December – March) is warmer of course, but is also the wettest season, with frequent heavy showers.",
        howToGetAround:
          "While this geography makes Peru an exciting country to visit, it also makes it a challenging one to navigate. Paved roads between regions are often absent, the railway network is sparse, and most flights require a connection through Lima, the capital city. But don’t be discouraged by the logistics – exploring this country is a real adventure and worth every minute of extra planning. Here’s our guide to getting around Peru.\nDomestic flights, train rides and car transfers are part of most Peru travel itineraries, while (very long) bus rides are an option for travelers with more time and an adventurous spirit to match.",

          "1. Ceviche\nCeviche. It's Peru's national dish, the best versions of this marinated fish dish are in Lima and it's the freshest, zestiest and healthiest dish you will ever have. While Lima may not be the ancestral home of the ceviche, you can find delicious fine dining recipes and street food versions here.\n\n2. Lomo Saltado (Beef stir-fry)\nAnother very famous Peruvian dish that you should definitely try is Lomo Saltado. Originating in Lima, this dish is made out of marinated sirloin steak that is then stir-fried with red onions, tomatoes and the most important ingredient, Ají Amarillo which is a hot pepper. It is usually served with rice and french fries on the side.\n\nTo create Lomo Saltado, Chinese chefs in Peru's Chinco neighbourhood took to the streets of Lima and started sautéing beef in a wok in the early 19th century. Lima's Calle La Concepcion, often known as Peru's Barrio Chino, is the birthplace of Lomo Saltado but nowadays the famous dish can be found all over the country.\n\n3. Pollo a la Brasa (Roasted Chicken)\nPollo a la Brasa is the famous Peruvian style of roasting a whole chicken on a rotisserie. The dish is served with French fries and salad but most importantly with the delicious ají verde sauce that is mixed together out of cashews, sour cream, mayo as well as jalapeños to give it a bit of spice.\n\nThis is a relatively new dish in Peru and usually eaten for dinner which for Peruvians is around 8-10pm. It was first established in the Chaclacayo neighbourhood in the year 1950. Roger Schuler, a Swiss immigrant living there, studied his cook's methods and eventually tried his hand at preparing chicken. Go to one of the many restaurants in Lima that have this meal on their menu and share a Pollo a la Brasa with friends or family.",

Machu Picchu\nBest for trekking\n\nOne of the New Seven Wonders of the World and Peru’s greatest claim to tourism fame, Machu Picchu lives up to its hype as a mystical and awe-inspiring 15th-century archaeological site. Built with incredible precision, attention to detail and at great height of 7972ft (2430m) above sea level, Machu Picchu includes temples, private quarters and ceremonial platforms that continue to radiate sacred energy. Machu Picchu, meaning “old peak” in the indigenous Quechua language of the Andes, can be reached by a two-hour train ride from the Sacred Valley town of Ollantaytambo, or the truly intrepid can walk in the footsteps of the Incas along the classic Inca Trail, a four- to five-day trek that traverses 26 miles (42km).\n\n2. Get the most out of Lima\n3. With most travellers drawn irresistibly to the tourist hubs of Cusco and Arequipa, the charms of the capital, Lima, are often overlooked. With coastline, mountains and jungle mere hours from the capital, Lima offers respite and exciting alternatives to the stifling crowds and bus travel that await you along the Gringo Trail.\n\nLunahuana offers white water rafting and vineyards. The adobe buildings of Tarma hark back to pre-Colombian times, with jungle and South America’s deepest cave nearby.\n\nIf you get stuck in the capital, don’t despair as there are lots of things to do, many for free. Consider a walking tour of the UNESCO-listed colonial town with Inkan Milky Way; it's free, although a donation is appreciated. \n\n3.  Discover another side of Cusco\n4.  With Macchu Picchu and the Inca Trail just over the hills, most travellers are tempted to get out of Cusco as soon as possible. But for the patient visitor prepared to extend their stay by a day or two, this stunning colonial city reveals even more of its charms.\n\nA Boleto Turistico del Cusco pass gives access to 15 key historic sites. Then head out to Sacsayhuamán, overlooking the city, and walk back down to Cusco through the San Blas neighbourhood, the artisan quarter, with its galleries and boutiques.\n\nNext head out to the Sacred Valley, the valley of the Urubamba River, where you can visit the historic Inca sites at Pisac, Ollantaytambo and Chinchero. If it’s a Tuesday, Thursday or Sunday, visit Chinchero market (which isn’t as touristy as the more famous Pisac market), and the adjacent textile cooperative for a spot of shopping. The pre-Incan salt pans – or salineras – at Maras are worth a visit too.",

They also form a significant diaspora (omogenia), with many Greek communities established around the world.[46]\n\nGreek colonies and communities have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, but the Greek people themselves have always been centered on the Aegean and Ionian seas, where the Greek language has been spoken since the Bronze Age.[47][48] Until the early 20th century, Greeks were distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of Asia Minor, the Black Sea coast, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, Egypt, the Balkans, Cyprus, and Constantinople.[48] Many of these regions coincided to a large extent with the borders of the Byzantine Empire of the late 11th century and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient Greek colonization.[49] The cultural centers of the Greeks have included Athens, Thessalonica, Alexandria, Smyrna, and Constantinople at various periods.",
