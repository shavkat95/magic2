        "longIntroduction": "World-famous, beautiful, charming and exciting, the Alps often sound more like movie stars than mountains. Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland each offer an assortment of winter and summer sports, National Parks, and scenic tours on this legendary mountain range arcing 750 miles from Genoa to Vienna. Sample the region’s richly flavored mountain cheeses, comforting rosti, and the beloved communal dishes of fondue and raclette. Sip festive drinks like schnapps, glühwein, and punsch to name a few. The Alps boast castles and gardens, spas and yodeling, alpine cowbells and schuplattein dancing. Across distinct mountain cultures and abundant attractions, the Alps are extraordinary even when you’re not wearing skis. Raise your European vacation to its greatest heights in the Alps\n",
        "bestTimeToGo": "The best time to visit the Alps is in summer, when the mountains are bursting with color, livestock are grazing on high alpine pastures, trails are clear of snow, mountain huts are open, and wildlife re-emerge from their winter slumber. \nSummer in the Alps is equated with active pursuits like hiking, trekking, via ferrata climbing, and cycling. It’s the best time to explore and drink in the mesmerizing scenery of Europe’s highest mountains. \nHowever, summer is also the best time to learn about Alpine culture. In fact, we think you’ll fall in love with the cuisine and culture of the Alps just as much as the landscapes. \n",
        "howToGetAround": "How to get around\nSome routes are made famous by the incredible scenery reached by traveling with characteristic trains, funiculars, cable cars, ferry and buses. Combining maybe the use of the bicycle, your vacation will be even more memorable.\nThe Alps are served by three major international airports. The TGV and TER trains connect you to the big cities in the region. Shuttles and coach busses help you reach the villages and resorts – or you can always come by car.\n",
        "foodMustTryRecommended": "__1. Fondue__\nOne way to enjoy cheeses from the mountain cows is to make the traditional fondue. Fondue means “melted” in French, and is made with 2 to 3 different cheeses depending on the recipe. You sit with your friends or family around a hot pot of melted cheese and dip pieces of bread. The challenge is not to drop your bread in the common cheese pot. Because it’s a rich warm dish it is typically enjoyed in cooler weather, anytime in the winter and during cool summer nights after a hike.\n\n__2. Raclette__\nThe raclette is another popular way of enjoying melted cheese in the mountains, this time with more flexibility. In the fondue, the cheeses are picked in advance and everyone eats from the same pot. In the raclette, you also share a central heated device. In past times, people in the mountains used wood fires or coals, or gas, for the raclette, while nowadays the devices are mostly electric. The most common raclette device is the one with 6-8 small individual cheese melting containers. However in some restaurants, especially the ones that like to keep it old style, you will find the classic raclette device that hold an entire half wheel of cheese.\n\n__3. Tartiflette__\nMore melted cheese dishes? Welcome to the French Alps. The tartiflette is very similar to the raclette and fondue, but the mixing work is already done for you. Potatoes, lardons (French style bacon}, crème fraiche, and Reblochon cheese are baked in the oven in a gratin casserole style dish.\n",
        "thingsToVisitRecommended": "ouch down in any buzzing Alpine city and you’ll be surrounded by snowcapped Alps, teeny villages, and bucolic landscapes spreading out into the horizon. This is two very different worlds in one magnificent trip.\nStart off in Zurich’s car-free old town, walking the Limmatpromenade, and staying up till morning taking in the city’s world-class nightlife. Relish the music, because soon you’ll be in quiet Bregenzerwald, Austria. Twelve villages make up this portal back into a simpler time, and centuries-old farmhouses and cheesemakers set the pace. Going on foot is the best way to soak in the long-lost architecture and serenity of this almost-off-the-map spot.\nAlternatively, make a beeline straight for Germany, where you can contemplate the silence filling the depths of Schwarzwald, or the Black Forest. And yet you’re still not far from 3-star Michelin restaurants and water-filled adventures — Lake Titisee, the largest lake in this untamed wilderness, is right here, too (be sure to dip your toes).\n",

Tanzania’s national parks are designed to suit all kinds of interests, preferences and comfort levels, and you can be rest assured that there is a safari which is perfect for you.\n",
        "bestTimeToGo": "The best season to visit Tanzania is during the long dry season, which falls from July to September. These are considered the best months for safaris, the Great Migration, trekking, and beach holidays in Zanzibar. Of course, these months are peak travel season.",
        "howToGetAround": "Tanzania has three international airports served by a wide range of international and regional airlines (with particularly good connections to other parts of Africa and the Gulf). In Dar es Salaam, Julius Nyerere International Airport is the busiest international hub, with connecting flights to regional airports and private airstrips all over Tanzania.\n\nKnown as the “Gateway to Africa’s Wildlife Heritage,” Kilimanjaro International Airport (between Arusha and Moshi in Hai District), is served by flights from a handful of countries in Europe and the Middle East, plus local hops and charter flights to and from northern Tanzania's national parks.\n\nOver in Zanzibar, Abeid Amani Karume International Airport brings in travelers looking for white sand, blue skies and warm ocean waters, with lots of connections to African capitals and the Middle East, and seasonal flights from Europe.",
        "foodMustTryRecommended": "Tanzanian cuisine is diverse. The types of ingredients used and preparation methods vary greatly from region to region.

Ugali is a Tanzanian national dish and something that the average person eats about four times a week. It’s an affordable dish that can be found on the menu of every local restaurant. In schools, particularly in public schools, it’s eaten almost every day of the week with beans, vegetables, soup, dagaa, and other types of fish.\n",

There are a number of locations you can go diving however, Nungwi on the northeast tip of Zanzibar is definitely a great location to start.\n\nYou will encounter amazing sea creatures such as seahorses, whitetip reef sharks and turtles among the corals. Prices for diving start from €80 and vary depending on how many dives you go on and how many days you spend diving.\n\nThe city of Stone Town is the historical heart of Zanzibar, it is known for its narrow alleyways, Arabian townhouses and a busy port.",

        "longIntroduction": "Peru is a country in South America that's home to a section of Amazon rainforest and Machu Picchu, an ancient Incan city high in the Andes mountains. The region around Machu Picchu, including the Sacred Valley, Inca Trail and colonial city of Cusco, is rich in archaeological sites. On Peru’s arid Pacific coast is Lima, the capital, with a preserved colonial center and important collections of pre-Columbian art.",
        "bestTimeToGo": "The winter (May – September) is the driest season and therefore the best time of year to travel, especially if you're planning to visit Cusco or trek to Machu Picchu. The summer (December – March) is warmer of course, but is also the wettest season, with frequent heavy showers.",
        "howToGetAround": "While this geography makes Peru an exciting country to visit, it also makes it a challenging one to navigate. Paved roads between regions are often absent, the railway network is sparse, and most flights require a connection through Lima, the capital city. But don’t be discouraged by the logistics – exploring this country is a real adventure and worth every minute of extra planning. Here’s our guide to getting around Peru.\nDomestic flights, train rides and car transfers are part of most Peru travel itineraries, while (very long) bus rides are an option for travelers with more time and an adventurous spirit to match.",
        "foodMustTryRecommended": "1. Ceviche\nCeviche. It's Peru's national dish, the best versions of this marinated fish dish are in Lima and it's the freshest, zestiest and healthiest dish you will ever have. While Lima may not be the ancestral home of the ceviche, you can find delicious fine dining recipes and street food versions here.\n\n2. Lomo Saltado (Beef stir-fry)\nAnother very famous Peruvian dish that you should definitely try is Lomo Saltado. Originating in Lima, this dish is made out of marinated sirloin steak that is then stir-fried with red onions, tomatoes and the most important ingredient, Ají Amarillo which is a hot pepper. It is usually served with rice and french fries on the side.\n\nTo create Lomo Saltado, Chinese chefs in Peru's Chinco neighbourhood took to the streets of Lima and started sautéing beef in a wok in the early 19th century. Lima's Calle La Concepcion, often known as Peru's Barrio Chino, is the birthplace of Lomo Saltado but nowadays the famous dish can be found all over the country.\n\n3. Pollo a la Brasa (Roasted Chicken)\nPollo a la Brasa is the famous Peruvian style of roasting a whole chicken on a rotisserie. The dish is served with French fries and salad but most importantly with the delicious ají verde sauce that is mixed together out of cashews, sour cream, mayo as well as jalapeños to give it a bit of spice.\n\nThis is a relatively new dish in Peru and usually eaten for dinner which for Peruvians is around 8-10pm. It was first established in the Chaclacayo neighbourhood in the year 1950. Roger Schuler, a Swiss immigrant living there, studied his cook's methods and eventually tried his hand at preparing chicken. Go to one of the many restaurants in Lima that have this meal on their menu and share a Pollo a la Brasa with friends or family.",
        "thingsToVisitRecommended": "1. Machu Picchu\nBest for trekking\n\nOne of the New Seven Wonders of the World and Peru’s greatest claim to tourism fame, Machu Picchu lives up to its hype as a mystical and awe-inspiring 15th-century archaeological site. Built with incredible precision, attention to detail and at great height of 7972ft (2430m) above sea level, Machu Picchu includes temples, private quarters and ceremonial platforms that continue to radiate sacred energy. Machu Picchu, meaning “old peak” in the indigenous Quechua language of the Andes, can be reached by a two-hour train ride from the Sacred Valley town of Ollantaytambo, or the truly intrepid can walk in the footsteps of the Incas along the classic Inca Trail, a four- to five-day trek that traverses 26 miles (42km).\n\n2. Get the most out of Lima\n3. With most travellers drawn irresistibly to the tourist hubs of Cusco and Arequipa, the charms of the capital, Lima, are often overlooked. With coastline, mountains and jungle mere hours from the capital, Lima offers respite and exciting alternatives to the stifling crowds and bus travel that await you along the Gringo Trail.\n\nLunahuana offers white water rafting and vineyards. The adobe buildings of Tarma hark back to pre-Colombian times, with jungle and South America’s deepest cave nearby.\n\nIf you get stuck in the capital, don’t despair as there are lots of things to do, many for free. Consider a walking tour of the UNESCO-listed colonial town with Inkan Milky Way; it's free, although a donation is appreciated. \n\n3.  Discover another side of Cusco\n4.  With Macchu Picchu and the Inca Trail just over the hills, most travellers are tempted to get out of Cusco as soon as possible. But for the patient visitor prepared to extend their stay by a day or two, this stunning colonial city reveals even more of its charms.\n\nA Boleto Turistico del Cusco pass gives access to 15 key historic sites. Then head out to Sacsayhuamán, overlooking the city, and walk back down to Cusco through the San Blas neighbourhood, the artisan quarter, with its galleries and boutiques.\n\nNext head out to the Sacred Valley, the valley of the Urubamba River, where you can visit the historic Inca sites at Pisac, Ollantaytambo and Chinchero. If it’s a Tuesday, Thursday or Sunday, visit Chinchero market (which isn’t as touristy as the more famous Pisac market), and the adjacent textile cooperative for a spot of shopping. The pre-Incan salt pans – or salineras – at Maras are worth a visit too.",

And then, of course, there's the famous Great Wall, winding for 6,700 kilometers all the way from the Yellow Sea to Central Asia, while its countless shrines exude the spirit of age-old Eastern religions.\n\nThanks to its size, China as a tourist destination offers limitless scope for exploration.

        "longIntroduction": "New York City comprises 5 boroughs sitting where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean. At its core is Manhattan, a densely populated borough that’s among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers. Its iconic sites include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and sprawling Central Park. Broadway theater is staged in neon-lit Times Square.",
        "bestTimeToGo": "New York City is at its best from April to June and September to early November when the weather is comfortable and there are fewer crowds of other visitors. If you're traveling with kids or on a budget, then you might want to visit during the summer or winter instead for the best overall experience.",

It's on my mind pretty much more than anything else throughout my waking (and most likely sleeping) moments.  #thisiswhyimfat\nAnd shocker, Tyler is the same way.  We talk food almost every single day.  New restaurants to try.  Recipes ideas.  Our recent successes and failures in the kitchen.  Current conversation is mostly about our new kitchen toys (sous vide machine), eating ramen in NYC, and wanting to recreate said ramen at home.\n\nAnd that got me thinking about all the great food I've been blessed with consuming (and thus carrying around on my waistline... and arms, legs, and double chin) in and around NYC.\n\nSo it's about time I shared with you The Top 10 Foods You Have To Eat In NYC.  And I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.\n\nIt was a bit surprising actually, especially considering I told you about The Top 10 Foods You Have To Eat In Paris and My Top 12 Places To Eat In San Francisco after just visiting them each once.",
        "thingsToVisitRecommended": "1. Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island\n2. The top spot on this list may not be a surprise, but there’s no doubt that both of these attractions are a must when you’re in New York.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty is the symbol not just of New York but of America. And Ellis Island represents our nation, too — after all, almost half of Americans can trace their ancestry back to this one island.\n\n2. Broadway\nThe Theater District is home to over 40 Broadway theaters, which is why New York offers some of the best live theater on the planet. Whether it’s a new musical, the latest smash-hit or the long-running classic, seeing a Broadway show transports you out of your seat and into a new reality. That’s the magic of Broadway!\n\nOne of our guides shared lots of great insider tips for exploring the area in our Broadway behind-the-scenes blog post. He has a few suggestions for tickets, but know that although prices may be steep, there are ways around it. For example, you can visit the TKTS booth in Times Square or sign up with TodayTix for discounts on the go.",
